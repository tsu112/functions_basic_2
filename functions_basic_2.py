# 1 Countdown - Create a function that accepts a number as an input. Return a new list that counts down by one, from the number (as the 0th element) down to 0 (as the last element).
# Example: countdown(5) should return [5,4,3,2,1,0]

# count = []


# def countdown(num):
#     for x in range(num, -1, -1):
#         count.append(x)
#     return(count)


# print(countdown(5))

# 2 Print and Return - Create a function that will receive a list with two numbers. Print the first value and return the second.
# Example: print_and_return([1,2]) should print 1 and return 2

# def print_and_return(a, b):
#     print(a)
#     return(b)


# print(print_and_return(1, 2))

# 3 First Plus Length - Create a function that accepts a list and returns the sum of the first value in the list plus the list's length.
# Example: first_plus_length([1,2,3,4,5]) should return 6 (first value: 1 + length: 5)

def first_plus_length():
    list
